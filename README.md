## Overview

The AI Career Guidance Assistant is an intelligent system that leverages advanced language models to understand user interests, skills, and preferences through natural language input. It provides personalized career path recommendations with detailed explanations and follow-up questions to guide users in their career exploration journey.

Built for real-world applications in education, counseling, and talent development environments.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Process user input in conversational format
- **Intelligent Preference Extraction**: Automatically identify interests, skills, and traits
- **Smart Career Mapping**: Match user profiles to relevant career domains using semantic similarity
- **Personalized Explanations**: Generate detailed reasoning for recommendations
- **Interactive Follow-ups**: Provide thoughtful questions for deeper exploration
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quantify recommendation reliability with numerical confidence values
- **Conversation History**: Track and review previous recommendations for continuity

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Preference Extractor** (`preference_extractor.py`)
- Analyzes natural language input using LLM-based processing
- Extracts structured data: interests, skills, and personality traits
- Handles ambiguous or unclear inputs with fallback mechanisms

**Domain Classifier** (`domain_classifier.py`)
- Maps extracted preferences to predefined career domains
- Implements confidence scoring algorithms for recommendation reliability
- Supports multi-class career path classification

**Explanation Generator** (`explanation_generator.py`)
- Creates personalized career recommendations with detailed justifications
- Connects user preferences to specific career requirements and opportunities
- Generates human-readable explanations for AI decision-making

**Fallback Handler** (`fallback_handler.py`)
- Generates clarifying questions for unclear or insufficient inputs
- Provides domain-specific follow-up questions for career exploration
- Implements error handling and edge case management

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Hugging Face API token with appropriate model access
- Git version control system

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miloni0731/career-guidance-ai.git
   cd career-guidance-ai
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure API credentials**
   
   Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in the project root:
   ```toml
   [api]
   hf_token = "hf_your_hugging_face_token_here"
   provider = "Featherless"
   model_name = "sarvamai/sarvam-m"
   ```

### Running the Application

**Streamlit Web Interface**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

**Command Line Interface** (Optional)
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage Example

### Input
```
"I love designing and solving puzzles, but I don't like reading too much theory."
```

### System Output
```
Extracted Profile:
â”œâ”€â”€ Interests: designing, solving puzzles
â”œâ”€â”€ Skills: problem-solving, creativity
â””â”€â”€ Traits: analytical, creative
